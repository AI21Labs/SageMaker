    "This sample notebook shows you how to deploy **Jurassic-2 Mid** (formerly Grande Instruct) using Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jurassic-2 Mid is a best-in-class large language model (LLM) by AI21 Labs. As a mid-sized model, it is carefully designed to strike the right balance between exceptional quality and affordability. Apply Jurassic-2 Mid to any language comprehension or generation task such as question answering, summarization, generating long-form copy, advanced information extraction and many others. It also supports non-English languages including Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch.\n",
