It is only a 5 minute walk to Central Park, and 2 minutes to the nearest subway station. There\u2019s a good restaurant at the bottom of the hotel as well. Staff was friendly. Only real gripe was there were no ice machines, or small fridges in the rooms. We\u2019d stay again for sure. ", "This is our second time staying at the Empire. We really do like this hotel. Love that we are so close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Broadway, but most of all Central Park! Our mornings and evenings always start with Starbucks (in same building) and a walk/rock climb in the park. \nThe only complaint we had this time was the temperature in the room.. even though it was spring.. the room was so warm to the point we all had issues sleeping. We opened the window, but it was much too loud to keep open overnight. Beds were also pretty hard, which I didnt remember from our last stay.

Clean hotel.", "Good location but old hotel", "Was in a great area, would definitely stay here again. :)", "Empire Hotel was an exceptional stay with kind and supportive staff, clean rooms with charming historical character. We greatly appreciated our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone interested in visiting New York! ", "My only request would have been to have had a coffee machine in the room.

Great location ", "We were impressed about how the doorman always welcomed us and the excellent staff.   The maids were tip top.   Plan to come again when our son sings at the Met.

Roaches in bathroom. Maintenance came to room three times and couldn\u2019t repair AC. Spent the first night burning up. Moved to another room that had no remote. It took them a day to bring us a remote. We were told by front desk that we would be reimbursed $100 for our inconvenience. However, when we checked out the front desk had no record of this reimbursement so it did not happen. The carpet was dirty and there are roaches. Great location but that\u2019s about it. Wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel and won\u2019t stay here again. ", "Ease of location to my destination. Clean and comfy.", "Friendly. Superconvenient for our visit!  We loved it.", "The Empire hotel has walls of paper. Street noise I could take, but the talk and laughter from the adjacent room was like I was in my bed amongst them - and at 3:30 am!\nAlso, had to search for a sign outside the hotel that the hotel was the hotel. Directions about the tv use and check-in and check-out times were non-existent. Fix these things and the hotel would be a great place to stay because of location. Right now I'd never return.", "The hotel rooms are very small. The hotel also added $500 in erroneous charges to my account post-check-out. I found some front desk workers rude. I\u2019ve called 5 times to get charges removed and keep getting transferred to lines that do not exist.", "Property was really nice staff was super friendly the only thing is every single amenity was not working or closed", "I want to thank the staff at the empire hotel! You guys truly made my birthday weekend, between letting us check in early as our flight got in at 11am and their friendly hospitality. I would definitely stay again. This location is close enough to catch the 1 train all through Manhattan and just a walking distance from Central Park. The rooms are a little small but it\u2019s New York, you kind of expect that already. ", "All things very good and fantastic neighborhood. Only the room a  bit small.

Didn\u2019t even stay the second night.  ", "Excellent, helpful staff and great location across the street from Lincoln Center and within walking distance of Times Square and the Metropolitan Museum. Oddly, no coffee pots in rooms and no room service. Fortunately, there was a Starbucks right around the corner.", "Great location and staff were very.pleasant.  I would there again.  The big downside.is no.coffee the.rooms. I have.traveled in.5.continents and never not had coffee in room. They need to be tranparent and have.it in their description ", "Air conditioner/heater broke the first night. Repairman in room at 10pm working on it. Thought he fixed it but the room ended up being 78 all night. Next day, Pasqual moved us to a new room. Unfortunately, we had to come back to the hotel from 3-5pm time period to make the switch. He was awesome. Gave us a room with a great view; however, the sink backed up and wouldn\u2019t drain in the new room. Feel like this hotel needs some major repair work done. Main lights on iconic roof sign had letters out. ", "The overall aesthetic of this place is great. The staff was extremely friendly and the room was well maintained.\n\nMy only gripe...the proximity of the toilet to the sink. It was literally put up against it.

The room was comfortable and clean.. would definitely recommend.", "Everything was amazing! I highly recommend!", "My mother and I very much enjoyed our stay at The Empire. This was my 5th trip to NYC and I will stay here again. The location was outstanding as I love the Upper West Side and you can walk to restaurants, coffee shops, Lincoln Center, and Central Park.

The room was clean and neat.  The location of the hotel is absolutely great. Close to great restaurants to grab dinner or breakfast. However, I didn\u2019t like that the tv was not updated.

You are virtually steps away from Lincoln Center and a few more to Juliard.

We stayed 3 nights and booked 2 rms, a Junior Suite 2 bd and a Superior room 2 bd. On both Expedia and Empire websites Junior Suite was classified with \"city view\" and Standard/Superior rooms had \"courtyard view\". I checked in, they gave me Junior Suite room #1012. Upon entering it had an overwhelming smell of mold and sewage and the 2 windows looked out to a BRICK WALL. I went back downstairs and Simone said there were no more Junior Suites and the only other room left in the entire hotel was a Standard 1 queen, which I took because I couldn't bear the smell of mold/sewage in #1012. The next morning I went to the front desk and the manager, Sarah, said she didn't have anymore Junior Suites with City View and could only refund me $50 per night, $150 total for 3 nights. This is simple math. I PREPAID $1,128 for the Junior Suite and $583 for the Superior room. If all you have is a downgraded Standard room, then you should refund me the $545 difference. I asked if I could have a late check out for both rooms at 7pm (instead of refunding $545) but she said no, that would be a 2 full nights room charge. I told her that I would dispute with my credit card, then Sarah asked for my cell# and email but no one contacted me or left a message at the front desk. Next morning, I went down to check out at noon and someone approved our late c/o at 7pm but for only 1 room. I still disputed with credit card co.

We found the bedroom furniture attractive, and the bedding clean and comfortable, But, compared to other NY accommodations, our room & bathroom were uncomfortably small with a dearth of outlets for charging our electronics, no place in the bathroom for our toiletries, no instructions for using the TV, no coffeemaker in the room or anyplace to get a cup until the Starbucks on the corner opened at 7 AM.

We kept the window cracked to let in fresh.   We were also disappointed that valet parking was no longer available, we were told it was due to union issues with the parking garage, not the hotels fault, but annoying. Especially since the parking garage wasn't able to find our vehicle and it took some time to find it. We absolutely love the location and the Empire Rooftop Bar, which we went to on this trip, so we will stay there again, but will definitely say something if there is a problem with the room.
