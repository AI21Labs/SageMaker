    "**AI21 Summarize** model offers access to our top-of-the-line summarization engine. It has been specifically developed for understanding long texts and providing a faithful summary of the original document. As a task-specific model, it can be easily integrated into existing systems without requiring prompt engineering: simply provide the text you want to summarize and get the best summary in the market (according to a [recent study](https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarize-api-outperforms-openais-models)).\n",
